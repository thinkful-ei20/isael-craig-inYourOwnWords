# In Your Own Words
* Scope describes how memory is accessed/allocated. Varialbles in global scope are available anywhere in the code. Local variables are only available within a scope/block of code.

* Global variables are usually avoided because they stay the whole time the application is running. They can also be modified unintentionally causing bugs or uninteded side effects.

* Strict mode prevents declaring variables withouth the key words 'const', 'let' or 'var' which helps prevent accidentally creating global variables.
